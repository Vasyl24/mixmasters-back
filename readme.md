# Description.

This is the Mixmasters project's server-side. It's built using the Express framework in a Node.js environment, with MongoDB as its database, and Cloudinary for image cloud storage.
The server's features include:

- authorizing and deauthorizing users, adding their information to the database, and enabling changes to be made to them within a user collection;
- working with the recipe collection involves: sorting existing recipes based on the frontend needs of the Mixmasters project, filtering them, adding recipes to specific users' favorites, and adding new recipes to the database.

## Technologies Used:

- Node.js: The backend server is built with Node.js, enabling efficient server-side JavaScript execution.
- Express: The web application framework, Express, is utilized to streamline routing, middleware, and HTTP request handling.
- MongoDB: We use MongoDB as a NoSQL database to store and manage data.
- Mongoose: Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB that defines schema and interacts with the database.
- Swagger: Swagger simplifies API documentation, facilitating developers' understanding and use of API endpoints.
- Cloudinary: Meanwhile, Cloudinary enables cloud-based image storage, streamlining the management and service of images within your application. To start, follow these steps.
